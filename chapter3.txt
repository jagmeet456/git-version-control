This is chapter 3. We will see how to go back to our previous version
What we have further learnt ->
1. git checkout fileName: to got to previous saved version
2. git remote add origin <remote_url>: sets the new remote
3. git push -u origin major: push our current remote repository to remote repo.
4. git branch branchName: Cretes new branch sideway by major branch
5. git branch: gives all branches and also tells which branch we are working on
6. git checkout branchName: shifts us from current branch to the branch branchName
7. git merge branchName: merges branchName with major branch (make sure we are currently in major branch before executing it)
