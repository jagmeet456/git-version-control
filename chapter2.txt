This is chapter 2. We have learnt the following commands:
1. git init: initialise the repository in current directory
2. git status: to know the status how many files aren't in stagnated area
3. git add fileName: adds the fileName to stagnated area
4. git commit -m "abc": creates new version of all the newly added staged files at this point
5. git log: tells the whole history of our repository version control
